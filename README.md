# Lab 3
For GUI Programming which covers this keyword inside DOM event handlers:
- How 'this' scope is determined by the way a function is called
- Using this inside a regular-function event handler to reference the element that fired the event
- Why arrow functions do NOT get their own this and using event.currentTarget instead
- Using .bind() to preserve object context inside an event listener
- Reading data-* attributes through this.dataset to build dynamic behaviour

There are 4 exercise.js files:
1) Multi-Button Highlight
	- Using changeColor function in a ForEach loop to change this .color-btn to yellow when clicked
2) Data Attribute Reader
	- using data-* to set swatch button colors to saved values using this keyword
3) Object Context Challenge
	- Made a CounterApp object to inc/dec and display a count attribute using this-keyword and bind()
4) Identifying an Arrow Function Bug with this-keyword
	- Fixed an arrow function that adds active attribute to button using this
	- Needed to get around lexical binding of this and arrow functions by using event.currentTarget method and event object generated on click

### Some concepts that clicked:
- Using forEach loops to add one function to multiple of similar class items in the DOM
- using data-* to get stored data attributes and update them dynamically (it's not bound to the code or static html but rather the DOM)

### Some challenges faced:
- Understanding Object Context when using this-keyword outside of an object's scope (in this case making sure inc and dec methods, which are in different event handlers, both point to the CounterApp obj)
	- Solution: using bind() to ensure clicking the buttons updates the CounterApp obj's count attribute
- Keeping intended bindings in arrow-functions, despite lexical binding
	- Solution: using the automatically created event object from the JS engine and passing it to the AF and using event.currentTarget to bind this to the event object (in this case the button clicked)

### For future projects:
- Understanding this binding
- Using data-* attribute to build dynamic behaviour
- Working with the event obj generated by the JS Engine to capture bindings for use of this-keyword
